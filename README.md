# HW3Portfolio

This project entailed creating a portfolio site from scratch that resembled the mockup given. It involved linking contact information including an external resume, creating flexboxes to display projects, and designing an intuitive UI expereince that is pleasing to the user. Below is a link to the live site. Links to the Resume in the header is active, as well as the Github link in the lower Contact Me section. I have attempted to link a screenshot of the final image, but am unable to create a link due to it being stored internally on my computer.
